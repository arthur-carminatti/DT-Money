# DT Money

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Welcome to the "DT Money" project, part of the 'Ignite' course by Rocketseat. In this project, we utilized ReactJS with TypeScript and created the project using Vite, a tool that provides quick and efficient configuration.

The DT Money project is a financial control application that allows users to add income and expense transactions. Based on these transactions, the application calculates and displays a summary of income, expenses, and the total available balance. Additionally, users can search for specific transactions within the financial history.
